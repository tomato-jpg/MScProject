Hi,

This is the GitHub repo for the codes I used for my MSc Individual Project: Development of an fMRI-Compatible Hydraulic Haptic Interface for Investigating Human Tactile Perception

The code was used on Arduino GIGA R1 Wifi Boards.
Rotary Encoder code is for reading encoder data, the encoders are used as displacement sensors in the system,
Step Response code is for the step response tests,
Speed Test code is for the varying speed tests.

Kind regards,
Kritisha
